# Denoising CSI in 5G RAN Using Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs)  

## Overview  
This project focuses on enhancing Channel State Information (CSI) in 5G Radio Access Networks (RAN) using a **Denoising Generative Adversarial Network (DGAN)**.  

### Why CSI Denoising?  
CSI is essential for **beamforming, link adaptation, and resource allocation** in 5G networks. However, **environmental noise, interference, and multipath fading** corrupt CSI measurements, leading to degraded network performance. Our GAN-based solution effectively **removes noise and reconstructs clean CSI**, ensuring **better reliability and communication quality**.

## Features  
- CSI Denoising using **GANs**  
- Synthetic CSI Data Generation  
- Evaluation Metrics: **MSE, PSNR, SSIM**  
- Visualization of **Noisy vs. Denoised CSI**  
- **PyTorch** Implementation

## Methodology  

### 1. Data Preparation  
#### Simulating CSI Data:  
- Generated synthetic CSI using **sine waves** with added **Gaussian noise**.  
- Converted CSI data into **PyTorch tensors** for deep learning processing.  

### 2. Model Architecture  
- **Generator (G):** Learns to generate clean CSI from noisy input.  
- **Discriminator (D):** Differentiates between real (clean) and fake (denoised) CSI.  

#### Loss Function:  
- **Binary Cross-Entropy (BCE) Loss**  
- **Mean Squared Error (MSE)** for reconstruction accuracy  

### 3. Training Process  
- **Adversarial learning** is used to train the GAN.  
- Losses for **G and D are monitored** for convergence.  

### 4. Evaluation & Results  
- Performance is measured using **MSE, PSNR, and SSIM**.  
- Visualized **Noisy, Clean, and Denoised CSI** for qualitative assessment.
